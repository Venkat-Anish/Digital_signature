# Digital_signature
A Digital Signature is used for same reasons of physical signature.The key players in this system are sender(who signs a message) and reciever(who verifies the signautre).
The sender signs the message m using the sceret key sk and sends the signature along with the message to reciver who verifies it with the public key pk of sender and returns a True if it is correct signature and false if it is forged.

The code implements the above signautre scheme in an interoperable fashion i.e. The java code can be used to sign the messageg and it can be verified using the python code and vice versa.
